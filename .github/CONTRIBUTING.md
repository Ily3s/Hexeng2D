Thanks for the interest you have towards Hexeng2D. Here are some informations that can help you understand how Hexeng2D works, and how to contribute to it :

## Understanding how the engine works

You can find the doc of Hexeng2D at doc/html/index.html (from the root of this repo).

Also I invite you to take a look at the Sandbox sub-project which is a demo that I use to debug Hexeng2D.
It is a small enough environement so that you can understand how the engine works.

## Naming Conventions

Here is how I name my stuff :

- variable_name
- function_name
- ClassName
- m_private_member
- s_private_static_member
- HXG_MACRO

***

This is it for the moment, there is no particular rules on how you should name your PR or whatever.
