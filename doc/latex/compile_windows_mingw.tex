From the \mbox{[}\href{http://www.mingw.org}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+mingw.\+org}} Min\+GW projectpage\mbox{]}\+:

Min\+GW\+: A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import libraries, augmenting the GNU Compiler Collection, (GCC), and its associated tools, (GNU binutils). Min\+GW provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native Windows programs that do not depend on any 3rd-\/party C runtime DLLs.

MSYS\+: A Minimal SYStem providing a POSIX compatible Bourne shell environment, with a small collection of UNIX command line tools. Primarily developed as a means to execute the configure scripts and Makefiles used to build Open Source software, but also useful as a general purpose command line interface to replace Windows cmd.\+exe.

Min\+GW provides a compiler/linker toolchain while MSYS is required to actually run the Port\+Audio configure script.

Once Min\+GW and MSYS are installed (see the \mbox{[}\href{http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+mingw.\+org/\+Min\+GWiki}} Min\+GW-\/\+Wiki\mbox{]}) open an MSYS shell and run the famous\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./configure}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{make install}

\end{DoxyCode}


The above should create a working version though you might want to provide \textquotesingle{}--prefix=\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}path-\/to-\/install-\/dir\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\textquotesingle{} to configure.

\textquotesingle{}./configure --help\textquotesingle{} gives details as to what can be tinkered with.
