\doxysection*{Port\+Audio\+Cpp -\/ A Native C++ Binding of Port\+Audio V19}

\doxysubsection*{Port\+Audio}

Port\+Audio is a portable and mature C API for accessing audio hardware. It offers both callback-\/based and blocking style input and output, deals with sample data format conversions, dithering and much more. There are a large number of implementations available for various platforms including Windows MME, Windows DirectX, Windows and Mac\+OS (Classic) ASIO, Mac\+OS Classic Sound\+Manager, Mac\+OS X Core\+Audio, OSS (Linux), Linux ALSA, JACK (Mac\+OS X and Linux) and SGI Irix AL. Note that, currently not all of these implementations are equally complete or up-\/to-\/date (as Port\+Audio V19 is still in development). Because Port\+Audio has a C API, it can easily be called from a variety of other programming languages.

Although, it is possible to use Port\+Audio\textquotesingle{}s C API from within a C++ program, this is usually a little awkward as procedural and object-\/oriented paradigms need to be mixed. Port\+Audio\+Cpp aims to resolve this by encapsulating Port\+Audio\textquotesingle{}s C API to form an equivalent object-\/oriented C++ API. It provides a more natural integration of Port\+Audio into C++ programs as well as a more structured interface. Port\+Audio\textquotesingle{}s concepts were preserved as much as possible and no additional features were added except for some `convenience methods'. 

Port\+Audio\+Cpp\textquotesingle{}s main features are\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Structured object model. 
\item C++ exception handling instead of C-\/style error return codes. 
\item Handling of callbacks using free functions (C and C++), static functions, member functions or instances of classes derived from a given interface. 
\item STL compliant iterators to host APIs and devices. 
\item Some additional convenience functions to more easily set up and use Port\+Audio. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Port\+Audio\+Cpp requires a recent version of the Port\+Audio V19 source code. This can be obtained from CVS or as a snapshot from the website. The examples also require the ASIO 2 SDK which can be obtained from the Steinberg website. Alternatively, the examples can easily be modified to compile without needing ASIO. 

Supported platforms\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Microsoft Visual C++ 6.\+0, 7.\+0 (.NET 2002) and 7.\+1 (.NET 2003). 
\item GNU G++ 2.\+95 and G++ 3.\+3. 
\end{DoxyItemize}Other platforms should be easily supported as Port\+Audio\+Cpp is platform-\/independent and (reasonably) C++ standard compliant. 

This documentation mainly provides information specific to Port\+Audio\+Cpp. For a more complete explanation of all of the concepts used, please consult the Port\+Audio documentation. 

Port\+Audio\+Cpp was developed by Merlijn Blaauw with many great suggestions and help from Ross Bencina. Ludwig Schwardt provided GNU/\+Linux build files and checked G++ compatibility. Port\+Audio\+Cpp may be used under the same licensing, conditions and warranty as Port\+Audio. See \href{http://www.portaudio.com/license.html}{\texttt{ the Port\+Audio license}} for more details.
